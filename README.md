## Installation

After cloning the repo to your local machine, change into the directory.

Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Good to go!

## Running

First, run `python main.py --help`

This will print out all the options that can (or need to) be specified to run.

For instance, in order to train a linear model on the mean feature for 2000 epochs with the epsilon coefficient in the loss set to 50, run

`python main.py --feature mean --model linear --epochs 2000 --eps 50`

The script will output into two directories (which are expected to exist before running, otherwise the script will fail!):

- `outputs`: this directory is expected to exist at the same level as the main.py script. It will contain the saved model.
- `figures`: this directory is expected to exist at the same level as the main.py script. Here we save plots from the evaluation of the trained model.

Furthermore, the script expects to find the file `feature_bank.npy` located in the `data` directory. The `data` directory must be at the same level as the main.py script.
